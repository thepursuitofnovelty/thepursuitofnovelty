- Hi, Iâ€™m Elina! I'm a Computer Science student at Stanford University. 
- Iâ€™m interested in exploring the world of software and its uses in biomedical research. I'm also interested in UI/UX design and human-computer interactions and how design enhances them. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning about computer systems and assembly, along with machine learning and naive bayes algorithms. 
- I'm proficient in Python, C++, and C, and I'm looking to collaborate on any projects that utilize ML to interpret biomedical data or utilize other programming tools to improve and optimize the function existing devices and structures.
